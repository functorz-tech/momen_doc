# Data Overview

Data is the core asset of an application, which is essentially about managing and processing it. Momen provides flexible and powerful data management and utilization capabilities, with the framework as follows:

## Data Source

Momen supports a variety of data sources, including built-in databases, APIs, etc. For more details, see: [Data Source](https://docs.momen.app/data/data_source).

## Data Usage

Once the data source is determined, it can be used by components and actions. For more details, see: [Data Usage](https://docs.momen.app/data/data_usage). It can also be used for formula and conditions. For more details, see: [Formula and Conditions](https://docs.momen.app/data/formula).

## Referencing via Variables

To achieve data reuse, data can be stored in variables. For more details, see: [Variable](https://docs.momen.app/data/variable).

## Passing via Parameters

Data transmission (e.g., between pages) can be achieved using parameters. For more details, see: [Parameter](https://docs.momen.app/data/parameter).
