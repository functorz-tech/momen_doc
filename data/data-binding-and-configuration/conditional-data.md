# Conditional Data

### **Introduction**

In this tutorial, we'll unveil the power of "Conditional Data" and how it allows you to display different content based on specific conditions, enhancing the user experience.

Before reading this, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with [Conditional Data Design](https://docs.momen.app/ui-design/design/interactions/conditions/conditional-data-design).

### **How to Use Momen to Display Other Content - Conditional Data**

Learn how to utilize Momen's "Conditional Data" to display specific content or text differently under various conditions. For instance, in the image below, we demonstrate how to determine a member's level based on their accumulated points. If a member's points are greater than or equal to 1000, their level is displayed as "Platinum." If not, the system checks if the points are greater than or equal to 500, and in that case, the member's level is shown as "Gold." Any other scenario results in the member being labeled as "Bronze."
