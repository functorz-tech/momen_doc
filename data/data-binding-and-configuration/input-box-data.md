# Input Box Data

### **Introduction**

In this tutorial, we'll explore the concept of "Input Box Data" and how it empowers you to collect and utilize user inputs for an enhanced web app experience. Discover the key to making your web apps more interactive and user-centric.

Before reading this, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with the [Text Input](https://docs.momen.app/component/text-input).

Input box data is the data generated when the \[Text Input] component is entered or selected. It can be found in the "Input Box Data" section.

ðŸ’¡Tips:

If your page contains multiple input boxes, it's advisable to give each input box a distinct name to prevent referencing errors.

### **Application Scenario**

Content entered by the live user via the \[Text Input] component, such as user name, cell phone number, title, and other text content. When it is necessary to write to a data table, you can use the "Input Box" data to reference it.

### **Using in Momen**

In the example below, a page incorporates two \[Text Input] components to capture user names and phone numbers, along with a \[Data Selection Input Box] for selecting dates. When these data entries are added to the data table, you can effectively retrieve and use the "Input Box" data to enhance your web app's functionality.
