# Logical Dataï½œ Is Logged In

### Introduction

To create a web page that caters to a user's login status, it's crucial to understand the logical data involved, and this tutorial will guide you through the process. This part is only used on the web to determine if a user is logged in.

Make sure you are familiar with the following two tutorials before reading this section:

Logical Condition Design

### Data Definition

1. The data type of "is logged in" is Boolean, true means logged-in, and false means not logged-in.
2. To exit the "is logged in": configure the "User Login -> Logout" behavior on the Logout button.

### Usage Examples

Learn how to use "is logged in" with an example from Momen.We expect the user to see a differentiated entrance to the personal center as "Visitor" and "Logged-in", and only logged-in users will be able to access the personal center.
