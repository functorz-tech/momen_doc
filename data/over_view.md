# Data Overview

The essence of an application is the management and processing of data; data is the core asset of an application. Momen provides flexible and powerful data management and utilization capabilities, with the framework as follows:

## Data Source

Momen supports a variety of data sources, including built-in databases, APIs, etc. For more details, see: [Data Source](https://docs.momen.com/data/data_source.html).

## Data Usage

Once the data source is determined, it can be used by components and behaviors. For more details, see: [Data Usage](https://docs.momen.com/data/data_usage.html). It can also be used for formula and conditional operations. For more details, see: [Data Operations: Conditional Judgments and Formulas](https://docs.momen.com/data/formula.html).

## Referencing via Variables

To achieve data reuse, data can be stored in variables. For more details, see: [Variables](https://docs.momen.com/data/variable.html).

## Passing via Parameters

Data transmission (e.g., between pages) can be achieved using parameters. For more details, see: [Parameters](https://docs.momen.com/data/parameter.html).
