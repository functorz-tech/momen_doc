# Blog

A blog should allow users to create articles, comment on them, bookmark their favorite content, and manage their personal profiles and interaction history. This requires setting up data access and permissions to ensure content visibility is appropriate and user privacy is protected.

### **Common Blogging Application Data Model Design**&#x20;

The data model for a blogging application typically involves several core tables: Users, Articles, Comments, and Favorites, as well as additional tables for Personal Profiles and Followers.

#### **Users Table**&#x20;

The Users table stores users' essential information, differentiating between ordinary users and administrators.

#### **Common Fields**

* **ID**: An integer that is auto-incremented and unique, serving as the unique identifier for users within the app.
* **Created\_at**: A timestamp that records when the user registered.
* **Updated\_at**: A timestamp that records the last update.
* **Name**: Text.
* **Email**: Text, unique.
* **Role**: Text, distinguishing between ordinary users and administrators.
* **My Articles**: A relational field created by establishing a one-to-many relationship with the Articles table, allowing users to access all articles they have created.
* **My Comments**: A relational field linking to the Comments table, enabling users to view all comments they have posted.
* **My Favorites**: A relational field linking to the Favorites table, enabling users to view all content they have favorited.

**Permission Configuration**
