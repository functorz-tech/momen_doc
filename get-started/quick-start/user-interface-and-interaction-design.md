# User Interface and Interaction Design

### **User Interface(UI) and User Experience(UX)**

UI, short for User Interface, refers to the specific interface that users see and interact with. UI focuses on the visual design and layout of elements such as buttons, text, images, and input fields on the screen. A good UI design should be aesthetically pleasing, intuitive, and clear, enabling users to navigate and interact with the product easily.

On the other hand, UX stands for User Experience, which encompasses the overall experience users have while using a product. It goes beyond just interface operation to include users' feelings, efficiency, and satisfaction during product use. The goal of UX design is to ensure that the product is not only functional but also provides users with a pleasant experience throughout its use.

In summary, when designing applications, it's essential to focus on two key points:

* The application should have an attractive and consistent UI design to highlight the unique features and branding.
* It should be easy to understand and facilitate.

If you are not a professional designer, it is recommended to seek inspiration from various design platforms or already existing applications.

### **Design Resources**

You can search for free graphic design resources online.

### **Design Process**

When you have already sorted out the product requirements and found your design inspiration, you can directly use the design tools or templates to implement your app design. Alternatively, you can roughly sketch a prototype with pen and paper, or seek assistance from professional designers to create a customized interface for you. If needed, Momen can also help you connect with professional and reliable designers.

### **Design with Momen**

[View Editor's Operation Instructions >](https://docs.momen.app/ui-design/editor/editor-overview)

Momen provides a proprietary visual editor and more than a dozen components, which can faithfully reproduce the design in the prototype at the pixel level, assisting you to design your application in a WYSIWYG manner.

You can add components and move them by dragging on the left-side toolbar, and **design layouts, bind data, and add interactions on the right setting panel.**



#### **Interface Design**

When using Momen to implement your design, you need to have a certain understanding of the basic design elements of Momen. By configuring pages, each properties of components, and combining various components to complete the design of pages and various functional modules on the page.

In addition, to adapt to screens and ports of different devices, you may also need to control the size, position, and other properties of components through flexible configurations.



#### **Interaction Design**

Currently, Momen mainly provides three interaction modes: Click, Hover, and Scroll.

"Click" refers to clicking on a component in the application by finger/mouse and then triggering interactions such as page navigation, upload and download file, data mutation, etc.;

"Hover" refers to triggering component size, layout, and position changes when the mouse hovers over a component;

"Scroll" refers to triggering component size, layout, and position changes when scrolling to a component or a certain coordinate point on the page.

In almost all interactions of components, you can configure "Action on Click" in the "Action" and configure "Hover" and "Scroll" interactions in the "Animation".
