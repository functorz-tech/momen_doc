# Configuration Guide

### Introduction

In this article, you'll learn how to configure your webpage.

### Web Page Configuration

After selecting a web page by clicking on it, you can configure the following in the "Design" section of the rightside bar:

* **Initial Screen:** Set this page as the first one displayed when entering the web application through a link.
* **Web Path:** Displayed in the browser tab after entering the web page.
*   **Web Title:** The path appended to the web link in the browser's address bar after entering the web page.

* **SEO Settings:** Expand to set the TDK (title, description, keywords) for the web page and configure the thumbnail for sharing the web link.

\- \*\*Size and Style:\*\* Refer to \[Layout] for configurations related to size and style.

### Loading Order of Data and Behavior

When opening a new page, the contents configured on the page load in a specific order. Understanding this order helps in correctly invoking actions and using data. The loading order is as follows:

1. **Link Data:** Receives link data from other pages if configured.
2. **Page Data:** Creates a page data object with an empty value, awaiting assignment.
3. **Page Load Action :** Executes configured actionss for when the page is loaded.
4. **Remote Data:** Starts reading remote data content. (There is no specific order for loading remote data on components and pages.)
5. **Component Data:** Displays local data or default values of each component.

### Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a page spans from when it is opened and starts loading content to when it is closed and unloaded.

#### Page Lifecycle Actions

You can configure actions for when the page is loaded and when it is unloaded:

* **Page Loaded Actions:** For example, display a splash screen ad with a countdown by configuring the countdown action.
* **Set Page Data:** Configure the behavior to set page data for the current page.

#### Trigger Conditions

* **Page Loaded:** Triggered when entering the application homepage for the first time.
* **Page Unloaded:** Triggered when navigating away from the page:
  * If page A navigates to page B, page A is unloaded and will reload upon re-entry.
  * If the behavior is set to close all pages and open a new one, the previous page unloads and reloads upon re-entry.

### Scheduled Jobs

Scheduled tasks are behaviors triggered at set time intervals until manually paused or the page is closed.

* **Trigger Interval:** The time interval in milliseconds at which the behavior is triggered.
* **Immediate Trigger:** Starts the scheduled task automatically when entering the page if enabled.

#### Manual Control

You can add a "Control Scheduled Task" behavior to a component to manually start or pause a scheduled task.
