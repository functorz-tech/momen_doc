# Deploying Your App

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to effortlessly launch and deploy your website using Momen. With just a click, you can make your webpage accessible to the world or customize a domain name for a more personalized touch.

## Release

When your web application is built, you can click the \[Publish] button in the top right corner of the editor to deploy and publish your application with one click.

For web applications, you need to generate the latest version through \[Preview Again]. This will create a QR code and web link in the release interface. You can scan the QR code with your phone or click the link to experience and debug your application in a real web environment.

Once debugging is complete, click the \[Publish Now] button to publish your web page. A new official QR code and web link will be generated.

If you want to configure a custom domain, click \[Go to Settings] to set it up.

### Publishing Web Pages with Custom Domains

**Domain Name:** The web link is also known as the "domain name." Automatically generated domain names are a jumble of letters, making them hard to remember and use. Custom domain names are often used to make web links more memorable and user-friendly. **Example:** The link for Google, [https://www.google.com/](https://www.google.com/), is a customized domain name. It defines the link content as the name of the company, Google, making it more convenient for users to access and use.
