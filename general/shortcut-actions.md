* **Windows:**
  * **Copy:** Select the component and press `control + c`, or right-click and select copy.
  * **Cut:** Select the component and press `control + x`, or right-click and select cut.
* **Mac:**
  * **Copy:** Select the component and press `command + c`, or use a two-finger tap on the trackpad to copy.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** If prompted "Clipboard has been disabled by the browser," go to the browser's \[Privacy and Security] settings to enable "Clipboard."

## Paste

After successfully copying or cutting, select the container (such as a page or list item) where you want to paste.

* **Mac:** Select the page or container component and press `command + v`, or right-click and select paste.

## Undo and Redo

If you make an error, you can use the undo shortcut to "revert" the action.
