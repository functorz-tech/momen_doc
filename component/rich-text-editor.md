### **Rich Text Editor Content**

To modify existing rich text content, you can pull this content from the database using remote data access and bind it to the rich text editor for further editing and updating.

#### **Output Configuration**

As an input component, the rich text editor interacts with database fields designated for text. During data addition or updating processes, the data from the rich text editor can be linked to the relevant database text fields. The data is then stored as HTML code in the database.
