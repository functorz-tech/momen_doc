# V1.0.6 - 2023.12.13

### I. Introduction

Momen's latest update, version 1.0.6, is here! Packed with exciting new features and enhancements. This release is aimed at enhancing your development experience. Let's explore the highlights!\


### II. New features

1. Focus Mode Update and Optimization

* Previously, entering focus mode on a component was done by double-clicking it, and double-clicking on a blank space returned to the previous layer. While this was simple to use, it wasn't clear where the user was positioned.
* Therefore, we've designed a new focus mode, where layers are displayed in a tiled format. This allows users to intuitively see the relationships between components and understand their current position, significantly reducing mouse clicks and lessening fatigue.

If you need to return to the old focus mode, it can be disabled in the global settings.

Additionally, we've made the following optimizations to the new focus mode:

* Support for adding components to a selected container using double-click or shortcuts (f: custom view, b: button, i: image, t: text)
* Direct dragging and dropping of components into various container components
* Support for dragging and dropping components within containers and pages for sorting
* In complex conditional containers, support for expanding all sub levels to the right

2. Support for Conditional Data Filtering

Enables configuration of multiple data sorting, filtering, and deduplication sets based on different conditions.

3. API Support for Default Value Configuration

* In previous designs, calling the same API multiple times with identical parameters meant repeatedly entering the same information. Hence, this version introduces the configuration of API default values, requiring only a single setting of default values, eliminating the need for repeated parameter entry. This reduces unnecessary repetitive operations.
* Additionally, default values are stored on the backend, ensuring sensitive information (like keys, tokens, etc.) is not exposed on the front end, significantly enhancing security.

4. New Filter - Blur

Introducing a new filter, blur, for display and view components.
