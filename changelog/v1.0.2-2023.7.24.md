This feature will provide better data management and enable you to build multiple front-end applications based on a single PRO project's backend.

2. New Focus Mode

We are revamping the Focus Mode to enhance your interface-building experience. The restructured Focus Mode will enable you to locate layers more easily and gain clearer insights into the flow of conditional logic. Expect an improved interface construction process with increased efficiency and precision.
