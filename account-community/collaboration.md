# Collaboration
The Momen tool provides powerful collaboration features, allowing multiple users to work on a single project simultaneously. This functionality is designed to enhance team collaboration efficiency, accelerate project completion, and facilitate real-time feedback. Through collaborative efforts, team members can seamlessly share ideas, co-edit content, and resolve issues promptly, significantly improving overall productivity.

## Accessing Collaboration Features
1. In the top-right corner of the Momen editor, click "Invite Collaborators."
2. Go to the User Center, select a project, click "Manage Project," and enable "Sharing and Permissions."

## Inviting and Managing Collaborators

After clicking "Invite Collaborators," you will enter a dedicated interface for managing project collaborators. You can invite collaborators by sharing a link or directly entering their phone numbers. You can assign different roles and permissions to each collaborator. Momen offers the following roles:

- **Owner**: The project creator has full control over the project, including editing, managing collaborators, and performing other advanced operations. This is the highest level of project permissions.
- **Administrator**: Administrators can edit project content, manage project participants (including inviting and removing them), and also have the ability to clone the project. This role is suitable for members assisting the project owner in team and project management.
- **Editor**: Editors have the permission to modify project content. This is the primary role for participants involved in creating and editing project content.
- **Viewer**: Viewers can only view project content and cannot perform any editing operations. This role is suitable for team members or stakeholders who need to stay informed about project progress but do not need to participate in editing.

By carefully defining roles and permissions, Momen ensures project security and collaboration efficiency, avoiding unnecessary errors caused by permission confusion.
