# Collaboration

Momen provides robust collaboration features, allowing multiple users to work on a single project simultaneously. This functionality enhances team efficiency, accelerates project delivery, and enables real-time feedback. Team members can seamlessly share ideas, co-edit content, and resolve issues promptly, significantly improving overall productivity.

## Accessing Collaboration Features

1. In the top-right corner of the Momen editor, click **Invite Collaborators**.
2. Or, go to the User Center, select a project, click **Manage Project**, and enable **Sharing and Permissions**.

## Inviting and Managing Collaborators

After clicking **Invite Collaborators**, you will enter the collaborator management interface. You can invite collaborators by sharing a link or entering their phone numbers. Assign different roles and permissions to each collaborator. Momen offers the following roles:

- **Owner**: The project creator with full control, including editing, managing collaborators, and advanced operations. This is the highest permission level.
- **Administrator**: Can edit project content, manage participants (invite/remove), and clone the project. Suitable for members assisting the owner in management.
- **Editor**: Can modify project content. This is the main role for content creators and editors.
- **Viewer**: Can only view project content, with no editing rights. Suitable for stakeholders who need to stay informed but not edit.

By clearly defining roles and permissions, Momen ensures project security and collaboration efficiency, avoiding errors caused by unclear permissions.
