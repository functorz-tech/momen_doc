# User Action | User Login - Logout

### **Introduction**

Learn valuable tips for executing the User Logout action, ensuring data security, and achieving quick logouts. Elevate your web app security and user management effortlessly with Momen.

### **User Logout**

Executing this action results in the user being logged out of the current account.

Closing the page doesn't automatically log out to the live user, ensuring their data remains secure. This action is typically employed for quick logouts, often coupled with tasks like refreshing user data, recalculating, or adjusting view conditions.

The live user logout operates exclusively within the current webpage, allowing the user to exit the current account without affecting information in the database, including the user ID.
