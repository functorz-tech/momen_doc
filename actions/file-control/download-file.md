## Introduction

Enhance your component with the ability to download files directly from remote data sources.

### Setting Up Remote Data

Configure a remote data source on the page that requests access to a data table containing the file data. Set the limit to one record and adjust the filter conditions to meet your specific business needs.

### Add Action

To enable file downloading, attach the "File Operation - File - Download File" action to your component. Then, bind this action to the file data that has been fetched from remote sources.
