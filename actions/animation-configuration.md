# Animation Configuration

### Introduction

Creating an engaging and interactive web could elevate the users experience. In Momen's latest update, we've introduced animations effects that breathe life into your web components. In this tutorial, you'll discover how you can elevate your web design with these interactive dynamic effects.

\
To enrich the interactive effects on the Web side, the current version adds animation for four components: button, image, text and video. The animation effects for other components will be updated in the future version.\


### Animation Adding Entrance

Add a \[button] in the editor, in addition to add interactive action in the component, you can also select the dynamic effects in the side bar.
