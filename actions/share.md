# Share to X (formerly Twitter)

## Introduction

Allow users to share content directly to X (formerly Twitter) by clicking a button. This feature supports sharing links, text, and images, which can be sourced from input fields, image selectors, or remote data. The shared content will be posted as a post on X.

## Action Configuration Guide

To enable sharing to X:

1. In the component's interaction settings, select the **Share to X** action.
2. Specify or bind the link and text content to be shared.
3. When the action is triggered, X will open in a new window or tab. Users can log in and share the prepared content directly.

This integration provides a seamless way for users to share content from your web platform to X, helping to increase engagement and expand social media reach.
