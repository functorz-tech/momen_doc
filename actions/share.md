# Share to Twitter

## Introduction   
Enable users to share content directly to Twitter by clicking a button. This feature supports sharing links, text, and images sourced either from input fields, image selectors, or fetched via remote data. The shared content will appear as a tweet.

## Action configuration guide   
In the component's interactions, set up the "Share to Twitter" action. Specify or bind the link, text content, and image you want to share within this action. Upon successful activation, Twitter will launch, allowing the user to log in and share the prepared content directly.

This configuration allows seamless integration with Twitter, providing a straightforward way for users to engage with and expand their social media presence directly from your web platform.
