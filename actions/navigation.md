- **Open an external link**

### Push to a Page

**Note:**  
To return to the previous page, you can either configure a button with a navigation action to the target page or use the browser's back button.

### Open in a New Tab

### Open an External Link

If the external link requires parameters, append them to the URL using a "?" followed by key-value pairs. Use "&" to separate multiple parameters.
