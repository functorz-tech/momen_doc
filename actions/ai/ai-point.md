# AI Point

AI Points represent the computing resources required for AI features in Momen. When using AI, points are deducted based on the number of tokens consumed by the large model.

- **Basic Version:** Each new project receives 50,000 free AI Points.
- **Insufficient AI Points:** If your balance runs out, operations such as data vectorization, vector sorting, and AI calls will stop working.
- **Delayed Processing:** After recharging, it may take a few minutes for previously unprocessed vector data to be generated.

## Checking and Purchasing AI Points

Go to the User Center. Hover over your project and click **Manage**. On the project details page, you can view your remaining AI Point balance and purchase more if needed.

## AI Point Consumption Details

- **Vector Data Storage:** AI Points are used when saving content as vector data in the database. This happens when vector storage is enabled for a field and data is added to that field.
- **AI Requests and Responses:** Points are deducted for both sending content to the AI and receiving its responses.  
  You can view detailed records of AI Point usage and additions in the **Order & Usage Details** section under project details in the User Center.
