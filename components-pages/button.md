# Button

### Introduction

Buttons serve as the bridge between users and actions, facilitating a wide range of tasks. In this tutorial, you'll explore their applications and learn how to make them an integral part of your web app's user interface.

### Application

Button is used in various scenarios where users need to click on the screen to trigger some actions. Common examples include adding data, jumping to another page, and so on. You can find more details in action descriptions, all of which can be triggered by button.

* Momen's buttons currently support a single click to arouse actions only. Complex interactions like long-press or double-click aren't available.
* Button customization options are relatively simple, allowing adjustments to background color, text color, fonts, and styles. Complex features like adding icons to buttons directly are not supported.
* Most components in Momen can have click actions. Look for the "Action on click" hints in the "Interaction" section of each component to configure click actions.

### Common Problems

In real-world scenarios, buttons often need diverse styles to suit specific design requirements. Buttons alone might not suffice.

Typically, it is recommended to use the "Image" component to replace the "Button" component. Upload an image to the "Image" component and configure the desired action. This can achieve the same effect as a button.
