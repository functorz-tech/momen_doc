# App & Page Control｜Set Global Data

### **Introduction**

In this tutorial, we'll explore the \[Set Global Data] action, allowing you to configure values for global data during the app's loading process. Before diving in, it's recommended to have a good understanding of Global Data.

### **Action Brief**

Configuring the value of global data, declared in the App Global Settings, allows for its application across all pages and components. Commonly used data, applicable to most pages, is designated as global data. The \[Set Global Data] action can be configured during the application's loading process to assign specific values to this global data.

### **Configuration Guide**

In unfocused mode, click the header toolbar, click App Global Settings, and add \[Global Data] to Global Data.
