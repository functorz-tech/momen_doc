# Deploying Your App

### Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to effortlessly launch and deploy your website using Momen. With just a click, you can make your webpage accessible to the world or customize a domain name for a more personalized touch.\


### Push your website to live with just one click

#### Preview

If you have built your webpage on Momen and you want to make it available for people worldwide to access, you need to first click on the "Preview" button in the upper-right corner of Momen to generate a QR code and a URL link as shown below. You can use your mobile phone to scan the QR code to view the mobile version of the webpage or click on the "Preview" link to open the webpage in a new tab for viewing.

### Push your website to live with a custom domain name

#### Domain Name

The webpage link is actually referred to as a 'domain name'. The automatically generated domain name consists of a series of random letters which are difficult to remember and use. Therefore, people usually customize their domain names to make them easier to remember and use. This allows visitors to access their webpage using a customized domain name, instead of using a default webpage address.

#### Example

The link for Google, [https://www.google.com/](https://www.google.com/), is a customized domain name. It defines the link content as the name of the company, Google, making it more convenient for users to access and use.\
