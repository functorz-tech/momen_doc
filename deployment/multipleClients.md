# Multiple Clients

A client refers to a front-end interface developed for different user groups or roles, all sharing a single back-end database. For example, an e-commerce app may have separate front-ends for users and administrators, or a business may create different portals for various departments.

## Value

1. **Customized Experience:** Develop dedicated front-ends for different user groups to provide a tailored experience and improve satisfaction.
2. **Security and Access Control:** Assign different access levels based on user roles and permissions. Admin portals may have advanced permissions, while user portals allow only basic operations.
3. **Improved Efficiency:** Specialized portals for each department streamline workflows and boost productivity.
4. **Reduced Complexity:** Separating features for different user groups reduces system complexity and maintenance costs.
5. **Unified Data Management:** All portals share the same back-end database, ensuring data consistency and simplifying management.

## Multi-Clients Guide

1. **Upgrade to Pro and Purchase Additional Clients:**  
   Projects must be upgraded to Pro to add multiple clients. If already Pro, adding a new client requires purchasing the Pro plan again (each additional client is half the current Pro price). For example: Pro ($99) + one client ($99/2) = $148.50/month. Upon purchase, the platform refunds based on the remaining days of the previous order.

2. **After Purchasing Additional Clients:**  
   The project will be split into three portals:
   - **Server (Back-end):** For managing data models and performing data management tasks.
   - **Web Client:** The default client for building front-end pages.
   - **New Client:** The newly added portal for designing additional front-end pages.

3. **Renewing Clients:**  
   Renewal pricing includes all clients and the Pro plan. To exclude a client from renewal, delete it before renewing.

4. **Version Downgrade:**  
   Downgrading to a non-Pro version makes all additional clients read-only (cannot be edited or published). The default client remains unaffected.

5. **Reactivating Clients After Upgrading to Pro Again:**  
   If the project expires and is later upgraded to Pro, you can choose to reactivate previously purchased clients (one-time only). Unactivated clients will be deleted.

## Notes

1. Projects must be Pro to add multiple clients.
2. **Publishing with Custom Domain:** For new clients, you can apply for a subdomain from a domain provider and publish each client with its own domain.
3. **Deleting Clients:** To avoid renewing a client, delete it before the next renewal.
4. **Reactivating Clients:** After expiration, when upgrading to Pro again, you can choose to reactivate previously purchased clients; otherwise, they will be deleted.
5. Clients that expire before January 22, 2025, will be deleted.
