### Schedule the Activation

After the plan upgrade, you can choose to activate the server right away or schedule an automated activation within seven days.

If you didn't select the activation option on the upgrade success page, you can still open the project details page and continue to schedule activation time in the reminder bar at the top of the project information.

### While Upgrading

During the server upgrade and activation, the project cannot be edited and the online application cannot be accessed. We recommend that you schedule the activation time based on your business requirements.



### Activation Successful

After the activation is successful, you will receive a system notification and email notification, and you can view the server status on the project details page.



### Activation Fail

If a server upgrade or activation fails due to network issues, you will receive a system and email notification. Our engineering team will solve the problem for you as soon as possible, and you can also contact us to follow up on the latest progress of the solution.
