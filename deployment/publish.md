## Publish with Custom Domain

Custom domains are supported for Basic Plan and above.

### Benefits

1. **Enhance Brand Identity:** A custom domain presents a professional image, making your site more memorable and trustworthy.
2. **SEO Advantages:** Custom domains can improve search engine trust and boost rankings.

### When to Use

1. **Corporate Website:** For businesses quickly building official sites, enhancing credibility and SEO.
2. **User Portal:** For companies integrating custom domains with existing systems, providing a unified, branded portal.

### How to Use

1. **Enter Your Domain**  
   Enter a domain you own. Ensure it is not used elsewhere.

2. **Domain Verification**  
   Momen generates records based on your domain. Add these to your DNS provider (e.g., Cloudflare):
   - Add a TXT record as instructed.
   - After adding, return to the custom domain page and verify. If successful, proceed.

3. **Certificate and Proxy Verification**  
   Configure TXT and CNAME records to validate the certificate and point your domain to Momenâ€™s proxy. For some DNS providers (e.g., Cloudflare), disable proxy and use DNS only for the CNAME record.
   - Return to the settings page and verify. Upon success, proceed.

4. **Web Favicon**  
   Upload a custom favicon. Save and publish the project again for the custom domain to take effect.

#### Notes

1. **Default Custom Domain:** If multiple domains exist, set one as default. Others will redirect to it.
2. **Editing a Custom Domain:** Unsaved configurations are retained for 24 hours. Once saved, only the icon can be modified.
3. **Deleting a Custom Domain:** If all are deleted, the app reverts to the Momen domain.
4. **Adding Records:** For some DNS providers, disable proxy and use DNS only for the CNAME record.
5. **Reconfigure Custom Domain:** Projects configured before January 17, 2025, must delete and reconfigure the domain, then republish for changes to take effect.
