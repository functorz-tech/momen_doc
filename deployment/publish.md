## Publish with custom domain
Momen supports publishing with a Custom domain for Basic Plan and above Projects. 

### Value
**1. Enhancing brand identity:** Binding a custom domain helps businesses present a more professional image. It makes the website more memorable and trustworthy, especially when the domain reflects the brand identity.
**2. SEO Benefits:**Using a custom domain can improve search engine trust, which in turn helps boost the website's search ranking.

### When to use
**1. Corporate Website:** Ideal for businesses that quickly build their official website using no-code tools. It enhances brand credibility and improves SEO performance.   
**2. User Portal:** Suitable for companies integrating custom domains with their existing systems, providing users with a unified and branded portal.

### How to use
**1. Input your domain**
- Input the domain that you owned. Please make sure that the domain has not been used in other applications.   

**2. Domain Verification**   
After inputting your domain, Momen will automatically generate records based on your domain information. You will need to add these records to your DNS provider. For instance, if you are using Cloudfare as your DNS provider, follow these steps:
- Add a TXT record as instructed by the platform.
- Once the TXT record is added, return to the custom domain page on the platform and initiate the domain verification process. If the verification is successful, proceed to the next step.

**3. Certificate and Proxy Verification**
In this step, you need to configure TXT and CNAME records to validate certificate and point your custom domain to Momen's proxy server. For instance, if you are using Cloudfare, follow these steps:
- Add TXT and CNAME records as instructed.
- Return to the setting page and initiate the certificate and proxy verification process. Upon successful verification, proceed to the final step.

### Notes
**1. Default Custom Domain:** When multiple custom domains exist, you can set one domain as the default. All other domains will automatically redirect to the default domain when accessed.   
**2. Editing a Custom Domain:** If a custom domain configuration is not saved, the platform will retain it for 24 hours. After 24 hours, unsaved configurations will be cleared. Once a domain is saved, only the website icon can be modified later.   
**3. Deleting a Custom Domain:** If all custom domains are deleted, the app will revert to being published via Momen domain.   
**4. Proxy statusï¼š**For some DNS providers such as Cloudfare, when adding the CNAME record, it is mandatory to turn off proxy to use DNS only in order to successfully access your domain.
