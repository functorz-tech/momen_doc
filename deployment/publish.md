# Publish Appliction
Once the web application is built, you can click the [Publish] button at the top right corner of the Editor to deploy and publish your application with one click.



## Preview 
For web applications, you need to use [Preview] to generate the latest version of the web application. A QR Code and a test version web link will be generated in the publish interface. You can scan the QR Code with your mobile phone or click the link to experience and debug your application in a real web environment.
