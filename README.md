## What is Momen?

[Momen](http://momen.app) is a no-code web application development platform and a PaaS that enables users to build custom web applications without writing code. The platform provides a visual canvas and a flexible data model, offering comprehensive tools for designing, developing, and deploying applications. Momen is designed to be accessible to users with limited technical experience while remaining powerful for advanced use cases.

## Why Choose Momen?

1. **Unified Development:** Streamlines the entire process from prototyping to deployment, featuring a robust built-in backend.
2. **Rapid Iteration:** Eliminate traditional development bottlenecks. Build applications in weeks and iterate quickly—no coding required.
3. **Predictable Costs:** Project-based pricing with no overage fees or reliance on third-party backend services. Costs are transparent and easy to estimate.
4. **Scalable by Design:** Advanced collaboration workflows and granular access control. Build fully customized applications that scale to millions of users from day one.

## About Us

Momen was founded by a team of engineers in 2019 who were frustrated by the repetitive nature of writing CRUD operations, API integrations, and CSS. We believed there had to be a better way—thus, Momen was born.

Our journey began as a no-code mini-program builder in partnership with a major platform. Within two years, we acquired over 130,000 users and launched 3,000 projects. In 2022, we expanded to the web and now serve users worldwide, powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
