# Introduction

### What is Momen
[really bad title]
[Momen](http://momen.app) is a no-code web application development tool and a PaaS that allows users to create custom web applications without coding. The platform features a visual canvas and a data model, offering tools for designing, developing, and deploying applications. It is designed to be accessible to individuals with limited technical experience.

### Why Momen

1. **Unified Development:** Streamlined from prototype design to app deployment, with robust built-in backend.
2. **Rapid Iteration:** Say farewell to traditional dev. Create apps in weeks, and iterate your ideas with ease - no coding needed.
3. **Predictable Cost:** Project-based pricing without overage fees and third-party backend service. Estimate costs upfront.
4. **Assured Scalability:** Advanced collaboration workflows with access control, build fully custom apps for million-user projects from the start.

### About Us

Momen was started by a group of Engineers in 2019. Initially, we were just irked by the repeated need to write CRUD code, API glues, and CSS. We thought to ourselves, there must be a better way. Hence the birth of Momen.

Our journey began as a no-code mini program builder in partnership with a major platform. Within two years, we acquired over 130,000 users and launched 3,000 projects. In 2022, we broadened our reach to the web and are now serving users worldwide, powered by AWS (Amazon Web Services).
