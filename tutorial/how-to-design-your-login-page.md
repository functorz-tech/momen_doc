# How to Design Your Login Page?

### Introduction:

In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll explore the importance of logins in the digital realm. You'll discover why managing user information, boosting engagement, and setting permissions are crucial. We'll also dive into different user identities, from guests to administrators, and provide insights on implementing versatile login methods using Momen. With a focus on best practices, you'll learn about data logging during registration/login by different login methods. Perfect for developers and business owners alike, this tutorial offers a concise overview of login systems.

### Why Are Logins Necessary?

1. **Managing User-related Information:** Content generated by users, their comments, and even interactions are strongly associated with individuals. Through a login system, a user's identity is generated, making it easier to establish a connection with their information. This facilitates the tracking and statistics of information ownership.
2. **Facilitating User Engagement:** By establishing login methods such as username and email login, it becomes easier to re-engage with customers subsequently.
3. **Implementing Permission Management:** Once a user account is created through the login system, we can apply different permission rules to different groups of users. This enables varying levels of access control over various pieces of information.

### Common User Identities

1. **Guests:** To ensure that certain functionalities can be used even when a user is not logged in, there exists a "guest" identity.
2. **Logged-in Users:** The website creator determines the criteria for what constitutes a login. Such logins can take various forms, including but not limited to email addresses, username-password combinations, and more.
3. **Membership Users:** Also referred to as "super-users". The criteria for these users are also customizable, based on registration duration, interaction frequency, and the amount recharged, among others. It's a highly flexible feature configuration.
4. **Administrators:** Typically refers to the operators or managers of a Momen project. They have the capability to execute actions beyond what regular users can do. In Momen, these permissions can be adjusted based on individual needs.

### Login Methods on Momen

Momen offers a diverse array of login methods to cater to different scenarios that developers might face. Once developers create a new project, all they need to do is click the **Settings** button in the top left corner of the editor, under **Login Settings**, to activate the desired login method.

After you've designed the UI for one or more login methods, you can add login interaction actions to the corresponding components. You can find actions like **Username Login** under **Interaction**. (This assumes that you have already activated the corresponding login configurations in the Login Settings.)

### Principles of Data Logging and Use during Registration/Login

**Let's take "Login with Username" as an example:**

Once the "Login with Username" mode is activated, Momen will enable a default data table created to store usernames and passwords. This table is invisible to users!

Upon successful user registration, Momen automatically inserts the username & password into this data table and adds a user record to the default account table, termed "Current User Data". The ID of this record is automatically associated one-to-one with the username & password data.

When establishing other data tables, if you need to set up a one-to-one or one-to-many data relationship between an individual and another table, simply relate the default account table with the other table.

After a user logs in, the **Current User Data** can be utilized to record the user's activity data.

The principles for recording login data and generating account data for other registration and login methods remain consistent.

Currently, when you register or log in using any of the methods, a new user record is created. So, it's advisable to configure only one registration/login method for now!

For example: User A, after registering and logging in with a username, generates user data with ID = 1 in the account table. If User A also registers and logs in with a phone number, it leads to the creation of user data with ID = 2 in the account table. Although it's the same User A, to the software, registering with a username identifies one user, while registering with a phone number identifies another...

Plans are underway to optimize and make this registration and login method more user-friendly in the future!

### Email/Username Login

Design the registration/login content on the interface, including the button for sending a verification code.

* Configure the action to send a verification code for the aforementioned button.
  * Choose the method of **Email** to send the verification code.
  * Set the type of verification code for either **Registration** or **Login**. (Ensure to separately configure the code-sending action for both registration and login).
  * Attach the corresponding registration/login actions for email to the registration/login buttons.
  * Bind the entered email and password (from the text input component) to the corresponding input fields of the action. Configure the actions or prompts for successful or unsuccessful registration/login.
