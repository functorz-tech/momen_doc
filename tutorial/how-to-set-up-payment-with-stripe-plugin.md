# How to Set Up Payment with Stripe Plugin

## Introduction

This guide demonstrates how to configure Stripe payments in Momen using Stripe's test mode.  
**Tip:** Always complete the payment process in test mode before going live.

**Example project:** [Stripe Payment Demo on Momen](https://editor.momen.app/tool/nwLdKMXyBXG/WEB?code=cLtSsuCGhuPaN)

![Stripe test mode](../.gitbook/assets/1%20(31).png "Stripe test mode")

## Step 1: Create a Stripe Actionflow in Momen

- Create an Actionflow for Stripe payments.
- Set up the Stripe Callback as the trigger.

![Configure Stripe Actionflow trigger](../.gitbook/assets/2.gif "Configure Stripe Actionflow trigger")

---

## Step 2: Configure Webhook in Stripe

- Go to [Stripe Webhooks (test mode)](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks) or navigate to **Developers â†’ Webhooks** in the Stripe dashboard.
- Create a new endpoint and enter the Callback URL generated in Momen.

![Configure webhooks in Stripe](../.gitbook/assets/3%20(19).png "Configure webhooks in Stripe")

- Add the required events to the endpoint.

![Select events in Stripe](../.gitbook/assets/4%20(17).png "Select events in Stripe")

- After setup, your page should look like this. Click **Add endpoint** to start listening for events.

## Step 3: Configure Payment Settings in Momen

- Enter your Stripe **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key** (test mode) from [Stripe API Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys).
- Set the Callback URL (from Step 1) and the endpoint secret (from the Stripe webhook page).

![Stripe API keys](../.gitbook/assets/8%20(5).png "Stripe API keys")
![Set callback URL and endpoint secret](../.gitbook/assets/9%20(4).png "Set callback URL and endpoint secret")

- Save and deploy your database.

## Step 4: Create a Data Model in Momen

Payment scenarios typically require an order model.  
**Note:** Stripe allows multiple payments per order. If your logic requires one payment per order, implement restrictions to prevent duplicate payments.

**Recommended data models:**
- **Payment:** Records order ID, Stripe payment ID, status, amount, currency, description, payment method. Use the payment's ID as the order ID for payment actions.
- **Event Log:** Tracks payment event stages (content, type, payment ID, Stripe payment ID), such as creation, in progress, failure, and success.

**Example logic:**
- On success: Add an event log, update payment status to "succeeded," set Stripe payment ID, and mark the order as paid.
- On failure: Add an event log, update payment status to "payment_failed," and set Stripe payment ID.
- For other statuses: Update Stripe payment ID and add an event log.

## Step 5: Modify the Actionflow in Momen

- After calling Stripe's payment API, you need to parse and handle the payment result in the Actionflow.
- Add a custom code node to extract and return key parameters:

```javascript
const body = context.getArg('fz_payment_callback_input');
const eventType = body.type;
const stripeObject = body.data.object;
const stripePaymentId = stripeObject.id;
const orderId = context.getOrderIdByStripePaymentId(stripePaymentId);
const paymentStatus = stripeObject.status;
context.setReturn('eventType', eventType);
context.setReturn('orderId', orderId);
context.setReturn('paymentStatus', paymentStatus);
context.setReturn('body', JSON.stringify(body));
```

- The `'fz_payment_callback_input'` parameter contains Stripe's callback data. The code above extracts and returns relevant fields for use in subsequent steps.

![Set Stripe parameters](../.gitbook/assets/13%20(1).png "Set Stripe parameters")

- Next, create an event log for the order.

![Create event log for order](../.gitbook/assets/14.png "Create event log for order")

- Finally, update the payment order based on the returned status using a conditional branch.

![Configure order update condition](../.gitbook/assets/15.png "Configure order update condition")
![Handle different payment results](../.gitbook/assets/16.png "Handle different payment results")
![Additional result handling](../.gitbook/assets/17.png "Additional result handling")

## Step 6: Call Stripe in Momen

- Typically, payments are initiated by a button click.
- **Important:** Users must be logged in before making a payment. Ensure registration and login actions are configured.

**Configuration steps:**

1. Enable user login in settings and deploy the database.

   ![Enable user login](../.gitbook/assets/18.png "Enable user login")

2. Add registration and login actions to the appropriate buttons.

   ![Add registration action](../.gitbook/assets/19.png "Add registration action")
   ![Add login action](../.gitbook/assets/20.png "Add login action")
   ![Login button example](../.gitbook/assets/21.png "Login button example")

3. After login is set up, configure the Stripe payment action.

   ![Configure Stripe payment action](../.gitbook/assets/23.png "Configure Stripe payment action")

   - **Order ID:** A long integer. The same order can be paid multiple times unless restricted by your logic.
   - **Currency:** Supported currencies: [Stripe Supported Currencies](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#supported-payment-methods)
   - **Amount:** Must be in the smallest currency unit. [See Stripe documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#zero-decimal)
   - **Payment method:** Defaults to bank cards; no need to specify unless required.
   - **Actions on success/failure:** Configure actions such as showing a toast notification.
