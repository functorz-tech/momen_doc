# How to Convert Momen App to Native Mobile App?

### Introduction

In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through the process of transforming your Momen web application into a mobile app.

### Purpose

This guide outlines the process of transforming a web application built with Momen into a mobile app and publishing it on the Google Play Store.

### Required Dependencies

1. Momen
2. Node.js
3. React Native
4. Java JDK
5. Android Studio

Note: While you can use any code editor of your choice, you must install Android Studio to obtain the necessary tools and environment for compiling your Android app.

### Implementation Path

1. #### Obtain the Momen Web Address

2. #### Set Up the Environment and Create a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) Project

3. #### Modify App.js and Create a WebView Link to Your Web Page

Install `react-native-webview`.

```bash
npm install react-native-webview
```

Link to the H5 page:

```javascript
/* eslint-disable react-native/no-inline-styles */
import React, {useEffect, useRef, useState} from 'react';
import {WebView, WebViewNavigation} from 'react-native-webview';
import {BackHandler} from 'react-native';

function App(): JSX.Element {

  const webViewRef = useRef<any>(null);
  const [backButtonEnabled, setBackButtonEnabled] = useState<boolean>(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Detect back button press in Android
    BackHandler.addEventListener('hardwareBackPress', () => {
      if (backButtonEnabled) {
        // WebView back
        webViewRef?.current?.goBack();
        return true;
      }
      // Exit app
      BackHandler.exitApp();
      return false;
    });
  }, [backButtonEnabled]);

  const onNavigationStateChange = (event: WebViewNavigation) => {
    setBackButtonEnabled(event.canGoBack);
  };
  
  return (
      <WebView
        ref={webViewRef}
        source={{uri: 'The address of the Momen-generated web page obtained in the first step above'}}
        style={{flex: 1}}
        setBuiltInZoomControls={false}
        // This step lets Android use the generated web page's own caching policy
        cacheMode="LOAD_CACHE_ELSE_NETWORK"
        onNavigationStateChange={onNavigationStateChange}
      />
  );
}

export default App;
```

4. #### Package the React Native Project to Generate an AAB

Follow the [official React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android) to:

1. Generate an upload key
2. Set up the Gradle variables
3. Add the signature configuration to the project's Gradle configuration
4. Generate the release AAB (Android App Bundle) package

Note: Packaging may involve configuring application icons, names, and other details.

5. #### Submit to the Google Play Store for Review and Release
