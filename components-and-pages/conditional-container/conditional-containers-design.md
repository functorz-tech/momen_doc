# Conditional Containers Design

### Introduction:

On many web pages, the content displayed often depends on certain conditions, like whether a user is logged in or not. This tutorial will guide you through the design of conditional containers in Momen. Specifically, we will focus on the "Conditional Container" component, showing you how to set up and configure different sub-containers based on specific conditions. By the end, you'll know how to show content according to user interactions or states on your webpage.

### How to Add Subcontainers in Conditional Containers

Drag a conditional container to the page. Edit the sub-containers on the top of the right side bar.

The function of the default \[Loading] sub-container is to process the content displayed when the data is not loaded and returned after entering the page, and generally we do not add any content to the \[Loading] sub-container!

You can click the Focus Mode button above the conditional container to enter the sub-container, and edit the content and conditions in a sub-container individually.

ðŸ’¡Tips: The judgment order of conditional containers is judged from left to right, when the previous condition is true, the content of the corresponding sub-container is directly displayed, and if the previous condition is not true, the judgment of the next condition is entered.
