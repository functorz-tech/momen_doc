# Select View

### Introduction

Explore the \[Select View] component in Momen's tutorial. Discover its capabilities for intuitive option selection, styling, and versatile applications in web development.\
Select View is a "list-class" component with many of the same features as [List](https://docs.momen.app/component/list).

### Usage Scenario

The Select View component can be used when an 'option' is required, and it provides selected/unselected, single/multiple-choice functions.

### Select View Design

Select views can be seen as list with "selection" functionality. You can set the style of the select view itself, and also click on the subview to edit the selected area or unselected area.

**Multiple Lines Display Content**

When we want to display the select view vertically, we can turn on \[Multiple Lines] and set the width of the select view to the same width as each child component, and set the width of the sub-view to 100%.

Multiple: Disabled by default, you can select multiple options after turning on Deselectable: Disabled by default, the selected option can be unchecked after clicking again Preserve Selection on Refresh: Disabled by default, and if the component is refreshed, the original selected content will still be retained

#### Sub-Container Design

There are two sub-views - Selected Area and Unselected Area inside the selected view, and you can set the content, size, and style of the sub-views respectively

* Unselected view: This view represents the appearance of the option when it is not selected.
* Selected view: This view defines how the option appears when it is selected.

#### Select View Contents

The \[Select View] component offers flexibility in data source selection, supporting both local and remote data. You can refer to our "[Data Retrieval and Display](https://functorz.feishu.cn/docx/F9D7dnJ4mondGYxiOQIcZStbnIf)" tutorial for comprehensive details.

**Local Data**

**Add options and default values:** When setting the default value, ensure it corresponds to one of the available options. For instance, if your options consist of "Basketball," "Soccer," and "Badminton," the default value should align with one of these three choices.

**Once a default value is designated, the associated option will be automatically selected by default (as demonstrated in the example below, where "Basketball" is the default value).**

ðŸ’¡Tips:

Order of Options: When selecting a view to display options horizontally, the order of options from left to right is determined by the order of the contents of the \[Select View] from top to bottom.

**Binding Option Content**: Double click \[Select View] to enter the sub-container, click the \[+] sign next to the input box and find "Component Data - Select View - item" to bind option content.

**Query Data**

1. **Prerequisite**: A corresponding options data table is created in the data model.
2. **Add option:** Adjust the data source to "Query Data" in the content of \[Select View], and select the created data table.
3. **List field & Default value:** You need to select the field to be checked by default and then specify the content of the default value based on the field type and content via inputs/data selection.

* For example: there are two fields in the type table: ID and username.
  * If you set the list field as ID, the default value is the ID of data in the type table.
  * If you set the list field to username, the default value will be the value of the specific username of a piece of data in the type table.

**Bind option content:** After entering the sub-container, establish a binding for the option content within the component responsible for displaying the options.

To do this, click on the \[+] sign within the content and locate "Component Data - Select View - Item".

ðŸ’¡Tips:

The purpose of setting the "List Field" after adding remote data to the Select View is to set the default value so that the content and type of the default value correspond to the content and type of the selected field.

#### Output Configuration

The result of the selection of a view can be bound to a component to display or to insert or update a data table by modifying the table data behavior. In order to accurately locate its data, it is recommended to rename the Select View component

**Single Select**

**Single Select of Local Data**

If your \[Select View] comprises three options in its local data, such as "Football," "Basketball," and "Badminton," selecting an option will result in the quoted value being the specific choice you made. When referencing the data from the \[Select View] using \[Inputs], it will reflect the value of the selected option.

**Single Select of Remote Data**

When working with remote data from a database table, this data often consists of multiple fields. To make the most of this data within a select view, you must specify which field from the remote data should be bound as an option when setting up the binding. Additionally, it's crucial to clarify which field from the remote data you intend to use when dealing with selection results.

**Example** Scenario:

Select the category of the products to be uploaded

Fields in the Product Category table: ID, Category Name, Category Sort, Status

Fields in the product table: product name, category name, category name ID, product price, etc.

* When you add product data to the product table using the Mutation to fill in the product category name, we bind the "Inputs - Select View - Category Name Field".
* If you are creating a one-to-many relationship between a product category table and a product table, and you need to record the category ID in the product table, the data bound to the corresponding field when you add data is "Inputs - Select View - ID".

**Multiple Select**

Multiple Select means that the result of the selection is not a single value but a set of data, which we call \[array].

**Multiple Select of Local Data**

If you select the view's local data, there are three options: "Soccer", "Basketball" and "Badminton".

The result of multi-selecting the first two options is an array of \[ "Soccer", "Basketball"].

To add selected multiple data to a data table using Mutation, you need to open the \[List Mutation] mode of Mutation and set the data source to \[Inputs - Select View]. As shown in the following figure, when you insert an account, you need to fill the name field with the result of multiple selections, so click the Set button next to the name field and click "Switch".

**Multiple Select of Remote Data**

If the remote data for the select view is derived from the product table in the database, as shown in the image below, selecting multiple product categories equates to choosing multiple pieces of data.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/112.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When adding multiple selected data to a data table using the Mutation, it's necessary to activate the \[List Mutation] mode within the Mutation and set the Source Data to "Inputs - Select View." Since each selected data contains multiple fields, you must specify which field should receive the contents of selected data.

As depicted in the figure below, click on "Source Data," select one of the required fields in the "Array Field Mapping," and then click the "x" icon in the upper right corner to close the selection. For instance, when configuring specific actions, you should input the results of a multi-selection into the "name" field. To do this, click the "Settings" button next to the "name" field and then select "Switch."
