# Multi- Frontends Configuration

### **Introduction**

A multi-client app enables the use of a central database through various user-specific frontends. For example, an online store may provide different interaction platforms for customers, and administrators.



### **Advantages of Multi-frontends**

Customized user experience: Custom interfaces for different users enhance personalization and increase satisfaction.

Access control: Multi-frontend frameworks offer role-based access, granting administrators robust management tools while preserving standard functionalities for users.

Increase productivity: Crafting interfaces for distinct departmental needs streamlines workflows and accelerates task completion.

Simplify system: Specialized features for different users reduce complexity and cut down on maintenance costs.

Unified Data Management: All interfaces share the same back-end database, ensuring consistent and accurate information access for both users and administrators.
