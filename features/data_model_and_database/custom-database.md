# Custom Database



### Introduction

You can select data tables and fields from the default database to generate a customized database for independent data sharing and management, reducing the risk of private data leakage and improving security when editing and sharing data.

### Basic Functions of Custom Database

1. A custom database is a subset of the default database.
2. Delete operations to the main database are synchronized to the custom database in real-time.
3. New operations in the main database, including adding new data models, fields and relations are not synchronized.
4. Supports renaming and filtering of names and field names when creating custom databases.
5. Supports for editable and actionable individual sharing of custom databases.
