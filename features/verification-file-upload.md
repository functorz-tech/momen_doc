# Hosting files in the root directory

Support users to upload .txt files to the root directory for validation purpose.

## Scenario
For instance, some services or systems (e.g., Google Search Console, website hosting platforms) require you to upload a specific .txt file to verify ownership of a website or domain. The file usually contains a unique code or token.

## File Upload

Upload the required .txt validation file via Project Settings > Global > Hosting files in the root directory.

##  Notes
