### **I. Page Introduction**

A simple login interface. Users need to register when they first access the product.

The page displays all the feedback collected. On the feedback list, users can upvote and comment on each feedback. By clicking the tabs "New" and "Trending," you'll see the feedback sorted in different ways, organized by popularity or time order. An integrated search box provides essential navigational functionality within the list view.

3. **Feedback Detail**

By clicking on the feedback card, you'll be directed to the detail page, where the content of the feedback is displayed in detail. Additionally, users can engage in discussions related to this specific feedback.

### **II. How to Configure Data**

#### **Step 1: Learn How the Data Model Works**

Located in the upper-left of the editor, you can inspect the structure of the project's data tables. The first step is to understand the association between several main tables and their corresponding informational segments displayed on the page.

#### **Step 2: Data Manipulation in the Database**

You can directly manipulate data in the database. Without the need to modify the frontend, data stored in the database is dynamic.
