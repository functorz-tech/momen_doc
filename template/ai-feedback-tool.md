By clicking the tabs "New" and "Trending," you'll see the feedback sorted in different ways, organized by popularity or time order. An integrated search box provides essential navigational functionality within the list view.

## How to Configure Data

### Step 1: Learn How the Data Model Works

Located in the upper-left of the editor, you can inspect the structure of the project's data tables. The first step is to understand the association between several main tables and their corresponding informational segments displayed on the page.

### Step 2: Data Manipulation in the Database

You can directly manipulate data in the database. Without the need to modify the frontend, data stored in the database is dynamic.
