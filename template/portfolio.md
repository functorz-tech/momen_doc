### **Introduction**

Introducing Momen's portfolio template. This template will help you build your personal website in minutes and present your best work in style. Customize the style based on your needs.

### **I. Basic Project Operation Logic**

【Homepage】: The initial page of your website. You can showcase your experience, works, and projects here, telling your users about your abilities. If you want to showcase more sections, you can customize it based on your needs.

【Consumer】: This table stores your own information. It is related to other tables such as projects, skills, education, etc.

【Project】: This table stores your project data. It has a one-to-many relationship with project details.

【Project Detail】: This table stores the project detail data.

### **Database Management**

The database is where you can browse and manage all your data. You can manage your projects here. The stored data is dynamic and changes based on your needs. Instead of writing all the content on your page, managing it here will be more streamlined.
