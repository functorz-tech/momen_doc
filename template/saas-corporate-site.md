### Step 2: Data Management

To modify data in a table, go to **Data Model > Database**. Here, you can update data bound to your project, including remote and list data.

To create a new entry, click **Insert Row**, edit the content, and click **Create** to save.

**Editing Data Outside Data Tables**  
The database is for backend data. To edit your UI, return to the editor.

Double-click a page to enter focus mode and modify elements. For example, use the right sidebar's 'Content' section to edit text.

Repeat this process for other components as needed.

### Step 3: Page Redirection

Double-click the text or image you want to configure for redirection. Click **Interaction** to edit, then click **+**, select **Navigation**, and choose the target page.
